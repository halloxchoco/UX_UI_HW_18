            <p>My name is Britt Cassidy and my pronouns are they/them.
                <br>    
                I know that design is an incredible tool that lets us foster real human connection, and I specialize in bringing that to my work. My skills include Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, creating dazzling user-focused prototypes, and playing well with others.
                <br>
                In my free time I enjoy creative writing, play games of all sorts (my favorites are DND and Animal Crossing) and consuming video essays on YouTube on a range of topics. I love learning new things all the time.</p>

            <h2>skills</h2>
            <h3>user research</h3>
            <p>I love talking with people and finding out their stories, their problems & potential solutions. Zoom recordings are my best friend when it comes to discovering who my user is.</p>
            <h3>user empathy</h3>
            <p>My empathy is my secret weapon, I have a knack for being able to put myself in the mindset of others, to form connections that enable me to really understand what people need.</p>
            <h3>persona creation</h3>
            <p>I bring my background in creative writing to my design work, as a natural storyteller I am driven to connect with my users and then tell their stories to guide my design thinking.</p>
